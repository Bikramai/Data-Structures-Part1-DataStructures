public class Main {
    public static void main(int[] numbers) {
        //O(1)
        System.out.println(numbers[0]);
        System.out.println(numbers[0]);
    }
}

Explanation of O(1) Or Constant Time:-
The above method takes an array of integers and prints the first item on the console.
It doesn't matter how big the array is. We can have an array with one or one million items.
All we are doing here is printing the first item. So this method has a single operation,
and takes a constant amount of time to run. we don't worry about the exact execution time in milliseconds,
because that can be different from one machine to another or even on the same machine.

All we care about is that this method runs in constant time, and we represent it using the big O of 1.
This is the runtime complexity of this method.

O(1) ---->Meaning --->Constant time
